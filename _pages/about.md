Welcome to my webpage! (Under construction... ðŸš§)

I am an MS (by Research) student at IIIT Hyderabad working on problems in computer vision, with [Prof Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and Prof Vinay as my advisors. Previously, I have had a wonderful experience as an intern in Prof Suyash's lab at IIT Bombay, where I worked on explainable deep learning and medical vision.
