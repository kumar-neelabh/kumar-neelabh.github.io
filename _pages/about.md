I am an MS (by Research) student at IIIT Hyderabad working on computer vision, with [Prof Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and [Prof Vinay](https://vinaypn.github.io/) as my advisors. Previously, I have had a wonderful experience as an intern in [Prof Suyash](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/)'s lab at IIT Bombay, where I worked on explainable machine learning and medical vision.
